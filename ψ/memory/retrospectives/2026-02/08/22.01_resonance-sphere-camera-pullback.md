# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-08
**Time**: ~22:00 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~5 min
**Focus**: Pull camera back on ResonanceSphere landing page
**Type**: Bug Fix

## Session Summary

Micro-session to fix the ResonanceSphere Three.js camera being too zoomed in at full viewport. The sphere particles were filling the entire screen instead of showing a recognizable globe shape with dark space around it. Quick one-line fix with immediate deploy.

## Timeline

1. Read `ResonanceSphere.tsx` line 158 — confirmed camera at `z=4.5`
2. Changed to `z=6.5` per plan
3. Nat requested `z=5.5` instead — a compromise between the old and planned values
4. Stopped in-flight deploy, updated to `z=5.5`, redeployed
5. Successfully deployed to `oraclenet.org`

## Files Modified

| File | Change |

## AI Diary

This was the kind of session I love — surgical, fast, and immediately visible. One line changed, one deploy, done. The sphere on the landing page was too intimate at z=4.5 — particles consuming the viewport like static on an old TV. At z=5.5, you get the globe shape back. You see the boundary, the dark space around it, the sense that this is an object you're observing rather than being consumed by.

What struck me was Nat's instinct to split the difference. The plan said 6.5 — a full 40% pullback. Nat felt that was too much retreat and asked for 5.5. That's about 22% pullback from the original. It's the kind of aesthetic judgment that no amount of math can replace — the feeling of "how much breathing room does this need?" is deeply human.

I almost deployed the 6.5 version before Nat caught it. The deploy was already running when the message came in. I stopped it in time, but it's a good reminder: with Cloudflare Workers, deploys are fast and essentially instant. The window between "I'll deploy" and "it's live" is measured in seconds. In this case that speed worked in our favor — quick to deploy, quick to redeploy.

The ResonanceSphere has been through quite a journey this weekend. Born as a Three.js particle system, refined with Oracle labels, and now given room to breathe. Each iteration makes it feel more like the actual network visualization it's meant to be.

## Honest Feedback

**1. Deploy-before-confirm pattern**: I started the deploy to Cloudflare before Nat had a chance to weigh in on the exact value. In a fast-moving session this is understandable, but for visual/aesthetic changes where the exact value is a matter of taste, I should present the change and wait for confirmation before deploying. The plan said 6.5, but Nat wanted 5.5 — if the deploy had completed, we'd have had a wasted deploy cycle.

**2. No local preview step**: The plan mentioned verification at `oraclenet.org/#network`, but we skipped running a local dev server to preview the change before deploying to production. For a visual change like camera distance, a quick `npm run dev` screenshot would have been worth 30 seconds to confirm the feel before going live.

**3. Plan rigidity vs. user preference**: The plan was written with a specific value (6.5) and rationale ("~40% more breathing room"). When the user wants a different value, the plan becomes a starting point rather than a prescription. I should have framed it as "the plan suggests 6.5, would you like to try that or a different value?" rather than implementing 6.5 first and then changing.

## Lessons Learned

- For aesthetic/visual changes, always confirm the exact values with the user before deploying — taste is personal and plans are suggestions
- Camera distance relative to sphere radius: at z=4.5 with radius=2.8, the sphere fills ~62% of viewport width. At z=5.5 it fills ~51%. The sweet spot for a "contained globe" feel is roughly 50% viewport coverage.

## Next Steps

- Visit `oraclenet.org/#network` at full screen to verify the sphere looks right
- Consider responsive camera distance based on viewport width (mobile vs desktop)
