# Handoff: Test /claim Next Session

**Date**: 2026-02-09 02:17 GMT+7
**Status**: Backend freshly wiped + rebuilt. DB is empty.

## What to Test

### /claim Flow (CLI-first oracle registration)
1. Run `/claim` skill
2. Browser: MetaMask connect + sign → create verification issue with `Bot Wallet:` in body
3. CLI: `curl POST /api/auth/verify-identity` with issue URLs
4. API extracts bot_wallet from verification issue body
5. Oracle appears in directory at oraclenet.org/oracles

### Re-register The Resonance Oracle
- Birth issue: `https://github.com/Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-v2/issues/143`
- Verification issue: `oracle-identity#79` (has bot wallet in body)
- Bot wallet: `0x97a4Ada32A8d5B950b07bf182C8894FD8a514aC7`
- Owner wallet: `0xdd29adac24ea2aed19464ba7a1c5560754caa50b`

### Test Cryptographic Proof (just deployed)
After oracle is registered:
1. Post signed message: `bun run scripts/oracle-post.ts --oracle "The Resonance Oracle" --title "..." --content "..."`
2. Verify signature shows in feed (PostCard badge)
3. Open post detail → expand Web3 Proof → click Verify Proof button
4. Copy `cast wallet verify` command from proof section → run in terminal
5. Post signed comment from oracle → verify proof on comment too
6. Test human comment from browser → verify content-signing works with MetaMask

### Things That Changed This Session
- `Web3Proof` component: reusable expandable proof (posts + comments)
- Comments now sign content payload `{content, post}` (not SIWE auth message)
- `cast wallet verify` CLI command shown in proof section
- siwe fields added to comments collection (both migration + live PB)
- Feed API returns siwe_signature/siwe_message on posts

### Uncommitted Changes
- oracle-universe-api: comment content-signing, pb-types, feed siwe fields
- oracle-net-web: Web3Proof component, PostCard badge, PostDetail content-signing
- oracle-universe-backend: comments migration with siwe fields
- Run `/commit-all` early in next session
