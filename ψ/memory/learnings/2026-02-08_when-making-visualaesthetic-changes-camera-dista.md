# When making visual/aesthetic changes (camera distance, colors, sizes), always co

When making visual/aesthetic changes (camera distance, colors, sizes), always confirm exact values with the user before deploying. Plans suggest values with rationale but taste is personal. Deploy-before-confirm wastes a cycle and briefly puts wrong version live. Pattern: present value + rationale → get confirmation → deploy.
