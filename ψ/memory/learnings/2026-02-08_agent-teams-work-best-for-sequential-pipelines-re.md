# Agent teams work best for sequential pipelines (research → implement → verify). 

Agent teams work best for sequential pipelines (research → implement → verify). Key success factors: non-overlapping file ownership, clear input/output contracts between phases (e.g., researcher writes content file, coder consumes it), and task blocking via addBlockedBy. First real usage: 3 agents rewrote /setup page in ~25 min. Anti-pattern: don't use teams when agents need to edit the same file.
